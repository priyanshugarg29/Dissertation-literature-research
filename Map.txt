## **Newly Integrated Sources**

### **Ooi et al. (2024, Cogent Engineering)**

**Ref (Harvard):** Ooi, L.-Y., Ting, C.-Y., Zakariah, H. and Chandar, E. (2024) ‘Behavioural user segmentation of app users based on functionality interaction patterns’, *Cogent Engineering*, 11(1), 2430430. [https://doi.org/10.1080/23311916.2024.2430430](https://doi.org/10.1080/23311916.2024.2430430).

**Summary:** Applied deep embeddings (autoencoder) to sparse app usage data, clustered with DBSCAN, validated with silhouette (\~0.36). Used SHAP + manual inspection to derive personas (Active User, COVID‑19 Preventer, Inactive, Average Joe).

**Link to dissertation:** Directly parallels our embedding → clustering → interpretability pipeline. Shows how latent clusters can be narrativised into personas for UX/onboarding optimisation.

**Placement:** Literature Review (embedding methods & interpretability), Discussion/Implications (journey design).

### **McKinsey & Company (2024, Digital Marketing Report)**

**Ref (Harvard):** McKinsey & Company (2024) *\[Exact title of uploaded report]*. Growth, Marketing & Sales Practice. McKinsey & Company.

**Summary:** Benchmarks AI‑powered segmentation/personalisation against traditional methods, showing higher engagement and lower CAC. Frames segmentation as a lever for both experience quality and efficiency.

**Link to dissertation:** Industry authority backing for indirect revenue loop — journey‑aligned segments improve satisfaction and engagement, reducing acquisition costs and boosting long‑term value.

**Placement:** Discussion (Managerial Implications), Executive Summary, Conclusion.

### **Growbo (2025, Industry Blog)**

**Ref (Harvard):** Ackerson, M. (2025) ‘Level Up Your Customer Segmentation Game in 2025’, *Growbo*. Available at: [https://www.growbo.com/customer-segmentation/](https://www.growbo.com/customer-segmentation/) (Accessed: \[date]).

**Summary:** Summarises McKinsey 2024 and HubSpot 2024 stats — AI segmentation associated with \~86% higher engagement and \~40% lower CAC. Reflects industry consensus on value of advanced segmentation.

**Link to dissertation:** Useful as corroborative industry pulse; should be secondary to McKinsey primary data.

**Placement:** Optional supporting citation in Discussion.

## **Cross‑Source Synthesis**

* **Latent → Persona → UX:** Ooi (2024) provides academic proof of concept for translating embeddings into personas guiding onboarding and feature flows.
* **Engagement → Indirect Revenue:** McKinsey (2024) supplies quantitative evidence that journey‑optimised, segment‑aligned strategies drive engagement and cut CAC.
* **Industry Consensus:** Growbo (2025) signals wider recognition and offers directional figures for narrative support.

## **Integration Recommendations**

1. **Lit Review:** Add Ooi (2024) to interpretability subsection, paired with Shi (2025) to show cross‑domain persona generation.
2. **Managerial Implications:** Insert McKinsey (2024) stats to support indirect revenue argument; optionally reference Growbo (2025) for additional colour.
3. **Dashboard Appendix:** Include cluster → persona mapping table; cite Ooi (2024) as precedent for persona naming and behavioural descriptors.
